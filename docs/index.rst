================================

``emcore`` is a basic library for cryo Electron Microscopy (CryoEM) image processing.
It is designed around three main components: images, tables and processors.
The library provides a well structured way to read and write the most used
file formats in CryoEM programs. It also provides basic operations for data
manipulation and analysis.
